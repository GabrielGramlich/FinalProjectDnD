# FinalProjectDnD
The intent of this program is to get a base character randomly generated for a Dungeons & Dragons one-shot. The user can fill some data in, but most is autogenerated.

## How to setup and run.
The software uses MySQL for now, until a later conversion to SQLite within the program.

Run the attached FinalProjectDB.sql file in MySQL to created the database; then run the FinalProjectPropagation.sql file to fill database with data; and finally run the FinalProjectUser.sql file to create the user the program uses.

Once the database is setup, it's as simple as running Main.Main() and going through Le GUI for some good ol' DnD fun.

## Known bugs (Unexpected features)
When moving from one page to the next, and finally back to a page where some ability scores were chosen, the combo boxes autofill with rolls 2-6, allowing the user to select their highest roll each time. I have a theory of how to fix this, but only time will tell if it's done by the submission deadline.
