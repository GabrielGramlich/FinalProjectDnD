# FinalProjectDnD
The intent of this program is to get a base character randomly generated for a Dungeons & Dragons one-shot. The user can fill some data in, but most is autogenerated.

## How to setup and run.
The software uses MySQL for now, until a later conversion to SQLite within the program.

Run the attached FinalProjectDB.sql file in MySQL to created the database; then run the FinalProjectPropagation.sql file to fill database with data; and finally run the FinalProjectUser.sql file to create the user the program uses.

Once the database is setup, it's as simple as running Main.Main() and going through Le GUI for some good ol' DnD fun.

## Known bugs (Unexpected features)
When moving back to a sheet where a language was selected, if that language is removed from chosen, it doesn't appear back in known languages, but only then.
