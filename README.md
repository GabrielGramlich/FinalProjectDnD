# FinalProjectDnD
The intent of this program is to get a base character randomly generated for a Dungeons & Dragons one-shot. The user can fill some data in, but most is autogenerated.

## How to setup and run
The software uses MySQL for now, until a later conversion to SQLite within the program.

Run the attached FinalProjectDB.sql file in MySQL to created the database; then run the FinalProjectPropagation.sql file to fill database with data; and finally run the FinalProjectUser.sql file to create the user the program uses.

Once the database is setup, it's as simple as running Main.Main() and going through Le GUI for some good ol' DnD fun.

## Known bugs (Unexpected features)
None right now. Tell me if you find some.

## Further fun
This project is by no means complete. Though almost everything in it functions as intending, there are definite aspect that have been intentionally omitted for the sake of timely completion. With 17 minutes til the deadline, that's definitely still including a decent amount.
